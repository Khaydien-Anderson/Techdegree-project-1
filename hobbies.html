          <h2>Sound Engineering/Design</h2>
          <p>I have spent over 10 years developing my craft as a recording and mixing engineer which stemmed from a passion of music.
            In this time I have got to expand my skills into the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Podcast recording and editing</li>
              <li>Sound design for adverts and TV</li>
              <li>Broadcast engineering for live radio</li>
              <li>Recording voice overs for actors</li>
              
            </ul>

          <h2>Property investing</h2>
          <p>A huge interest of mine is in investing. I already have a huge love for stocks and cryptocurrency investing. 
            My goal in the next 5 years is to buy my first property with the intentions to renovate and sell for a profit.
          
         These investments in property can give me opportunity to dive into the following areas of housing.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HMO'S (Housing with multiple occupation)</li>
            <li>Rent To Rents. (Renting property for a lower price and occupying it with your own tenants)</li>
            <li>Buy to rent (Buying property and renting out for a longterm return)</li>
            
          </ul>
